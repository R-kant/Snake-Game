A simple snake game built using HTML, CSS and JS. Checkout the app [here](https://snakegamewebapp.netlify.app/).

# Concepts Covered

- Object Oriented Programming in javaScript.
- Working of a Game Loop.
- Working with HTML Canvas.
- Deep dive in javaScript Arrays.

# How to play?

It's pretty easy to play with.

- Use arrow keys to control the movement of snake.
- For each apple snake eats the score is incremented by one.
- Game is over if snake collides with the border of the board or with itself.

# Loopholes

- The size of the board, snake as well as apple is hardcoded, so it lacks responsiveness.

# Scope of Improvement

- The snake head can be redesigned to make it look more attractive and different from the rest of the body.
- An animation can be played when the snake collides.
- Adding responsiveness is another great option.
